    # Grab CPI/Inflation data

    # Grab API/game platform data

    # Figure out the current price of each platform
    # This will require looping through each game platform we received, and
    # calculate the adjusted price based on the CPI data we received.
    # During this point, we should also validate our data so we do not skew
    # our results.

    # Generate a plot/bar graph for the adjusted price data

    # Generate a CSV file to save the adjusted price data
